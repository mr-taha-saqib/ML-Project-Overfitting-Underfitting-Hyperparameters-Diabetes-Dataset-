# Penguin Dataset ML Project (Python & R)

## 1. Introduction
Your order has been completed and coding files submitted for the dataset of Penguin you've suggested us to use. Both Python and R implementations completed as well. Some libraries were used as without that, execution of code was impossible to implement or achieve desired results. We covered all points including Bonus points and comments added per line. Thanks.

## 2. Dataset
The project is based on the **Penguin dataset**, which is widely used for practicing classification and regression tasks.  
It contains multiple species of penguins with attributes such as bill length, bill depth, flipper length, body mass, and sex.  

This dataset is ideal for exploring **Machine Learning (ML) models** to classify penguin species or perform regression analysis.

## 3. Implementations
The project includes implementations in **both Python and R**:

- **Python Implementation**  
  - Data preprocessing and cleaning  
  - Model training and evaluation  
  - Use of essential ML libraries for achieving results  
  - Inline comments added for clarity  

- **R Implementation**  
  - Data preparation and feature handling  
  - Model building and testing  
  - Use of R libraries for ML tasks  
  - Step-by-step comments included

## 4. Libraries Used
Some libraries were necessary as execution of code without them was not possible.  
Examples include (but not limited to):

### Python
- pandas  
- numpy  
- matplotlib / seaborn  
- scikit-learn  

### R
- tidyverse  
- caret  
- ggplot2

## 5. Bonus Points
We also included **bonus tasks** as part of the project:  
- Extended visualizations  
- Line-by-line commenting for clarity  
- Additional evaluation metrics

## 6. Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates **Machine Learning on the Penguin dataset** with implementations in **both Python and R**.  
All required tasks, along with bonus points, have been completed with detailed documentation and inline comments for better understanding.
